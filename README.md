## GodSVG Website

This is the source code for the GodSVG website. This is a basic website using HTML/CSS/JS. It's open source, just like GodSVG, however, please discuss potential changes in advance by starting an issue on this repository or joining the discussion in our Discord server.

Note: This repository is kind of ephimeral. I don't know enough about website development and such, so I suspect that it might get some technological debt over time that requires me to restart the repository.
